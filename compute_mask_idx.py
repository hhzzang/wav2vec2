    Computes random mask spans for a given shape. Used to implement `SpecAugment: A Simple Data Augmentation Method for
    ASR <https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08779>`__.

    Args:
        shape: the the shape for which to compute masks.
            should be of size 2 where first element is batch size and 2nd is timesteps
        mask_prob: probability for each token to be chosen as start of the span to be masked. this will be multiplied by
            number of timesteps divided by length of mask span to mask approximately this percentage of all elements.
            however due to overlaps, the actual number will be smaller (unless no_overlap is True)
        mask_length: size of the mask
        min_masks: minimum number of masked spans
